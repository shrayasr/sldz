    - sldz, cheesy way of saying slides

Props
- @jaseemabid for his flash talk at Rootconf2014 where he used slides with emacs, Cool!

Motivation
- Wanted to build out something like what @jaseemabid used within a few hrs before the flash talks.
- Wasn't able to present :(

Usage
- Write your slides in a single file (say foo.sldz)
- Each slide is seperated from the other by "==="
    
    [foo.sldz]

    Slide1
    ===
    Slide2
    ===
    Slide3

- $ ./sldz foo.sldz
- This puts you inside vim with 2 shortcuts
  - ] moves to the next slide
  - [ moves to the previous slide
  - Q quits 
- Happiness!
